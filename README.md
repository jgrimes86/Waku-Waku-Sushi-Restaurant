# Waku Waku

## Description

Welcome to the Waku Waku Sushi Restaurant!

This app includes responsive home, menu, reservation, login, and contact us pages. Users can view the menu of a mock restaurant, make reservations, and login. Login currently only supports administer-view, showing an overview of current reservations and which tables are filled. Users can then modify reservations, changing guest information, reservation time, and table assignment.

Waku Waku Sushi Restaurant is a phase 2 project for Flatiron School's software engineering course. This project uses React and React Router to create a single-page application with client-side routing. A JSON server is used to store application data locally.

This application was created by [Ling Zhou Chen](https://github.com/lingzhouc) and [Jim Grimes](http://github.com/jgrimes86).
